              <b>Michael F. Archer, Attorney at Law</b>, has been successfully representing
              adults and children in Social Security disability claims for over 30
              years. He has the experience necessary to lead his clients through the
              complicated eligibility rules for approval of disability benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Denial of benefits at the initial application level is quite common. Mr.
              Archer has assisted individuals at this level and at every stage of the
              proceedings through the hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. He
              also handles appeals to the Appeals Council and federal courts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to helping his clients, Mr. Archer has shared his expertise
              and knowledge with others by writing and speaking on disability related
              issues for community organizations, support groups, attorneys, and
              health care professionals.
