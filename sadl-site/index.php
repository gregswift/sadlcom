      <b>Michael F. Archer, Attorney at Law</b>, has been successfully
      representing adults and children in Social Security disability claims
      for over 40 years. He has the experience necessary to lead his clients
      through the complicated eligibility rules for approval of disability
      benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denial of benefits at the initial application level is quite common.
      Mr. Archer has assisted individuals at this level and at every stage
      of the proceedings through the hearing before an Administrative Law
      Judge. He also handles appeals to the Appeals Council and federal
      courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to helping his clients, Mr. Archer has shared his
      expertise and knowledge with others by writing and speaking on
      disability related issues for community organizations, support groups,
      attorneys, and health care professionals.
