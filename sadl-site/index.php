          <b>Michael F. Archer, Attorney at Law</b>, has been successfully
          representing adults and children in Social Security disability claims
          for over 40 years. He has the experience necessary to lead his clients
          through the complicated eligibility rules for approval of disability
          benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Denial of benefits at the initial application level is quite common.
          Mr. Archer has assisted individuals at this level and at every stage
          of the proceedings through the hearing before an Administrative Law
          Judge. He also handles appeals to the Appeals Council and federal
          courts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to helping his clients, Mr. Archer has shared his
          expertise and knowledge with others by writing and speaking on
          disability related issues for community organizations, support groups,
          attorneys, and health care professionals.
